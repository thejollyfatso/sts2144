    <h2>Nana called.</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You're certainly glad to know she was able to pick up the phone and call you by herself -- call the whole family by herself.  But you can't quite shake the feeling her voice gave you.  There was finality to it, like this was the last call she would make to you.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>Then again, that's always how she was: dignified, proud.  Even in her recent years of sickness, she refused to belly up.  Her body withered, skin discolored, her voice struggled to croak out.  But Nana's eyes never lost fire, never lost fight.  In her voice, you feared something had finally put the fire out.  Your brain is foggy as you fumble with your keys and the ignition.  For years of hospital visits, the sickness and process was normal -- up until now.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>When you arrive in her hospital room, you're greeted with the faces of all your extended family, and the pit in your stomach manages to sink even lower. Nana beckons for you to come in, taking the wind out of her.  The air still, the room quiet, as she hands you a small brochure.</em></p>
