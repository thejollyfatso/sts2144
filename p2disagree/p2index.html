    <h2>The phone rings.</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>It's Jeff.  You haven't heard from him since your argument a few days ago, and suddenly dread sets in.  After a moment, you pick up the phone.  "Where is Nana?" you ask without hesitation.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>"Relax, she's okay, everything went smoothly."</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>Your jaw drops.  "Jeff?"</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>"What?"</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>"What have you done?"</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>Jeff's silence is enough an answer, and the anger wells up.  You repeat yourself with some choice words.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>He sighs, deeply.  "You always were just like her.  Stubborn to the bitter end.  Now she can continue to be that way."</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You grimace.  Jeff didn't get it.  It was her last stand, her last hoorah, and he ripped that from her.  Jeff starts again, gentler this time, "Look, I wasn't able to make it to subscription tier without you.  But please, the first visit is free and I want you to have it.  Consider it an olive branch."</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You thank him out of manners and accept the offer.  There is some hanging quiet before Jeff finally says, "Hey.  Love you."  You nod, knowing full well he can't see it, and click off the phone.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>The VR goggles should arrive soon, and your first visit with Nana since her virtualization will happen.  The nerves rise -- you don't know how she'll react to seeing you.</em></p>
