    <h2>The goggles arrive.</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>The strap fits a little loose at first, but the goggles have heft and weight, indicating quality.  Maybe this is indication Nana's virtual life is also high in quality.  In the box is a thick manual, filled with more ads and payment tiers and warnings and instructions, legalities around ownership of the virtual world.  Maybe you're stalling, but you can't help sifting through every page.  As you reach the last page, the reality sets in that you will eventually have to face her.  You'll have to face the woman who told you she wanted to see the light and you shoved her into a bed with a pair of goggles.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You count to five in your head and slip into her world.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You hear birds chirping, but it doesn't sound like a song.  It sounds a like a sound byte.  The same chirping loops, and if you listen carefully, you can tell exactly when the sound of the wind starts over.  Every 20 seconds.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>The porch is nice enough.  The dirt out front is dug to shreds, but then Nana always like gardening.  Could the plants grow here?  Perhaps you'll know by the end of the month.  You turn to face the door, which is an eerily clean white.  Finally, you knock.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>Nana opens the door immediately.  She looks at you blankly and opens the door a little wider.  You shuffle your shoes on the doormat, which feels silly yet neccessary at the same time.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>The pleasantries are nice enough.  She waddles about, tidying up her little living room.  She offers a glass of water before realizing she has nowhere to get it from.  Was this the visitation you were emptying your pockets for?</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You can't tell if the fire in her eyes is gone, or if there aren't enough pixels to show it.  But you hope it's deep in there somewhere, as she asks you bluntly, "Why couldn't you let me go?"</em></p>
