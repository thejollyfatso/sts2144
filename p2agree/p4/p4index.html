    <h2>A few days later.</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>The phone rings.  You already know it's Jeff, and you really don't want to talk about it.  For a while, the buzzing seems like it would never stop, but finally Jeff's caller ID and contact photo fade from your phone into a voicemail notification.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You tap the notification, and his voicemail starts to play.  "Why did I just get a call from Love for Tomorrow?!  They said we failed to make subscription tier!   I thought you had me backed up on this.   Thanks to you we'll have to pay to see her per visit."</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>The words sting, and you don't bother to listen to the rest of the voicemail.  You don't care to get yelled at nor do you care to hear some obligatory apology.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><em>You check your phone as the email from Love For Tomorrow comes in.  A new link is provided, with one-time payments set up instead of monthly payments.  You might eat a little light this week, but you have enough UCC to see Nana today.</em></p>
