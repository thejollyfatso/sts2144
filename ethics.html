    <h2>Ethical Tensions Targeted</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Our story, “Nana Called”, is one that incorporates a lot of the themes and tensions that we have covered in class.  We were also inspired by the medical ethics readings, and this reading takes some cues from there.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">One of the major themes in this work is the downsides of utilitarianism, and how people can make bad choices with good intentions.  In the paths of the story where Nana is taken in for the “Love for Tomorrow” program, the narrator believed that these actions would be best for the family and for Nana.  Even if this action is done out of love, taking a utilitarian view to aim to raise the happiness of the family instead of having to deal with the loss of a loved one, the deep wound that is left in their relationship is unrepairable.  Nana suffers a lot from this decision; similar to the story of Omelas in which her suffering brings about happiness for others, Nana undergoes the same fate.  In the end, the narrator faces the consequences of this action, having Nana shut him out.  </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In medical ethics, the concept of patient autonomy and dignity is present in all fields of work. Though there may be something that doctors (or in this case, corporations) think is best for the patient, they should have the right of refusal.  In this body of work, Nana wasn’t afforded this luxury, with Jeff controlling her decisions and being able to decide what’s best for her.  But, in the theoretical case that doctors in this universe believed that this was the best for everyone, the ethics of keeping someone in this sort of virtual enclosure is complex.  There is the autonomy of Nana, which wants the ability to let go after living a long and fulfilling life.  However, is cutting off her virtualization a harmful act?  The act of shutting off this virtualization would be analogous to killing her, which most people agree is a negative thing.  This has a real world parallel in the fight for more accessible euthanasia, which would allow people to commit assisted suicide to end their suffering.  In cases such as this, is it more harmful to end their life, or to deny their autonomy and let them continue to suffer?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Finally, there is a constant theme of corporatism throughout the work.  The short novel features the corporation that takes in Nana, and the disastrous consequences of not paying.  People’s livelihoods are already boiled down to a series of numbers in the capitalist society of the United States: if you don’t have the money to be able to afford basic necessities like food or rent, then your choice is made for you to live on the street.  This scenario draws an analogy to this real life situation, but with a more literal and dystopian portrayal.  This corporation is able to take the lives of humans into their hands, and sell them at a steep cost, making it absolutely clear that no payment means that they will effectively die in this virtual world.  In a country where medical bills can break apart families, we decided that this source of tension was one that is very relevant to us today.</p>
